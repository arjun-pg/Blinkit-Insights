Hey, I'm Arjun 👋
Data Analyst | Power BI | SQL | Excel | Data Visualization
I enjoy exploring datasets and turning them into meaningful business insights. I work with SQL, Excel, and Power BI to analyze sales performance, customer patterns, and operational efficiency.

📦 Project — Blinkit Sales Performance Dashboard (SQL + Excel + Power BI)
This project focuses on analyzing Blinkit’s sales data to understand how different outlets, product categories, and fat content types contribute to overall business performance. I combined the strengths of SQL, Excel, and Power BI to prepare the data and build an interactive dashboard.

🔧 What I Worked On
Cleaned the raw dataset using Excel (formatting, splitting columns, removing inconsistencies)
Used Power BI Query Editor for advanced transformations and data modeling
Applied SQL for filtering, grouping, and validating key metrics
Added fully interactive slicers for outlet type, item category, fat content, and location
Created DAX measures for sales, average sales, item visibility, and outlet performance
Built a multi-page Power BI dashboard with comparison visuals and card KPIs
Performed EDA to identify high-performing categories and outlet trends

📈 Insights Discovered
Sales crossed $1.2M, with steady demand across multiple outlet types
Low Fat products generated higher sales than regular fat items
Tier 3 locations outperformed Tier 1 and Tier 2 in total sales volume
Medium-sized outlets delivered the strongest sales compared to small and high-size outlets
Snack Foods, Fruits & Vegetables, and Household items were top revenue generators
Outlets established between 2016–2020 showed the fastest growth in performance
Supermarket Type 1 sold the highest number of items across all outlet formats
